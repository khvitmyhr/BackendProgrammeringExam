You can run the system from Main (file BackendProgrammeringExamApplication).
This vil let you see the system from Postman or H2.

The tests can be ran from each file in the test folder.

Our system is complete including all functionallity and all tests.

And also creating a custome/address and add an address/customer to it.

For now our system is created so that one machine can only be sold in one order.
Out fabric only produces and machine of each, so this is by purpose a one to many relationship.
